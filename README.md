# Ironhands 

This repository contains the files for an HTML game called Ironhands. The game is currently in development, and the goal is to create a game where players can collect new mecha and level them up for use in battles against enemies. Players will be able to select from different mecha and attacks to defeat enemies, and progress through a story-driven campaign.

## Current Status
Currently, the game features a basic battle system where a player can select from four different attacks to use against an enemy. The game also includes a game over screen that displays whether the player won or lost the battle. This is the current starting point, and more features and mecha will be added in the future.

# Battle Screen (Working)

The Battle folder contains the files for a battle between a player and an enemy, with the player able to select from four different attacks to use against the enemy. The game also includes a game over screen that displays whether the player won or lost the battle.

## Files
* index.html: The main HTML file for the game, which includes the game's layout and structure.
* style.css: A stylesheet for the game, which sets the visual appearance of the game's elements.
* app.js: The JavaScript file that contains the game's logic, including the attack and game over functionality.
## How to Play
* Open the index.html file in a web browser.
* Use the attack buttons at the bottom of the screen to select an attack to use against the enemy.
* The battle will continue until either the player or the enemy's health reaches zero.
* When the battle is over, a game over screen will appear displaying whether the player won or lost.
* Click the "Restart" button to play again.
## Note
* The game uses external images, so you need an internet connection to play the game.
